# Spring Boot Weather App
A mini weather app created with spring boot to improve my skills.  
  
The user can select the cities available in the combo box.  
  
After they select the desired city, they click the button and learn the current weather information of the city.  
  
The weather data was obtained with Open-Meteo API: https://open-meteo.com/
  
With this mini project, I learned how to get data from an API as a JSON, parse it and then display it.
